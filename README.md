Ruby 2.5 and Rails 5 API example.  

More updates and detailed information soon.  

This is a basic, yet good, example on how to build Rails 5 Api-only applications. I did it to better understand why companies are changing their project architectures from monolithic to micro-services ones, with back and front-end concerns separated.  

How-to  
1. Make sure you have Ruby installed.  
2. Change config/database.yml and gemfile if you aren't using MySql.  
3. Run 'bundle install', 'rake db:create', 'rake db:migrate', 'rake db:seed'  
4. Start the api with 'rails server' and test it with http requests.
